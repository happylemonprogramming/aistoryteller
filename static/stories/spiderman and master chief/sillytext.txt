Spider-Man and Master Chief had to battle their way through hordes of rainbow-colored unicorns and giant teddy bears before eventually making it to the Kingpin's base. There, they teamed up and used their remarkable abilities to bake a delicious cake and lure the villain out. The Kingpin was so distracted by the smell of the cake that he surrendered, and the city was saved!

From then on, whenever the citizens were in danger, Spider-Man and Master Chief would come together and use their amazing baking skills to make treats and distract the villains away, creating peace and harmony throughout the land.
