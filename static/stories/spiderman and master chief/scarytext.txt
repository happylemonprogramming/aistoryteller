Spider-Man and Master Chief had to battle their way through hordes of enemies and eventually made it to the Kingpin's base. There, they faced the terrifying truth of what they were up against: an evil entity that had taken control of the Kingpin's base, turning it into a realm of horror from which no one could escape. With their remarkable abilities, the two brave heroes were able to fight off the monster, but not without great cost. When the battle was over, the city was saved but there was a price to pay. The cityspeople feared that the same terror would visit them again and begged Spider-Man and Master Chief to protect them in case that happened. As a result, the two heroes took it upon themselves to keep watch over the city and defend it from all threats, no matter how terrifying they may be.
