Once upon a time, there was a kingdom of magical creatures. At the center of the kingdom were two powerful wizards, one with red robes, and the other with blue robes.

The wizards had the ability to communicate with dragons, so they often rode them around their kingdom. The dragons were known for their strength, speed, and intelligence.

One day, the two wizards were trying to find a way to save the kingdom from danger. They were discussing ways to defeat a powerful monster that threatened the kingdom. Suddenly, an idea popped into their heads.

They decided to team up and use the dragons’ powers to their advantage. The wizards cast powerful spells and created a giant dragon armor for the dragons. The dragons flew and defeated the monster, saving the kingdom from danger.

The people of the kingdom thanked the wizards for their heroic deeds and gave them each a special gift. The wizards accepted the gifts and promised to keep protecting the kingdom from danger in the future.

And everyone lived happily ever after, thanks to the brave wizards and the dragons.
