One day, however, something changed. While Yeti was walking, he heard a voice in the distance. As he approached, he saw a small group of children who were in danger, being pursued by fierce mountain wolves. With no time to spare, Yeti stepped in and fought off the wolves with bravery and strength, saving the children from danger. 

The children thanked Yeti, and as they parted ways, they wished they could see him again. And then, it happened - a few days later, they saw Yeti and he became their friend. He would often come visit them and they would share stories and hot chocolate together.

From that day forward, Yeti became a legendary hero among the people of the north. He is still remembered today and will remain in the hearts and tales of the people of the north for many years to come.
