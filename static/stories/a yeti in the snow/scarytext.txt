One day, however, something changed. While Yeti was walking, he heard a voice in the distance. As he approached, he saw a small group of children. They were lost and afraid and Yeti could tell they needed help. So, instead of inviting them to come out of the snow, he invited them to stay with him and become his playmates. 

The children were scared at first, but as Yeti began to show kindness towards them, they soon became comfortable being with him. Little did they know, though, that Yeti had a sinister plan. On the third day, Yeti revealed his true identity - an ancient beast with an icy cold heart. The children were frozen with fear, unable to move or scream for help.

Yeti then took them under the snow, never to be seen again. But occasionally, there are whispers in the air that tell of Yeti's reign of terror in the snow. It is said that he still lurks in the snow, waiting for his next victims to pass by.
