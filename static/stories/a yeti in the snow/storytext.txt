Once upon a time, deep in the snowy mountains of the north, lived an amazing creature. His name was Yeti and he was the King of the North.

The snow was his kingdom and no one ever questioned why he was there. For he was kind, gentle and wise beyond words.

Every day Yeti would wander through the snow filled valleys and explore the beautiful wintery landscapes. He would take in the frozen air, the sparkling ice and the smell of pine trees.

One day, however, something changed. While Yeti was walking, he heard a voice in the distance. As he approached, he saw a small group of children. They were lost and afraid and Yeti could tell they needed help. So, he offered his assistance by leading them out of the snow and back to safety.

The children thanked Yeti, and as they parted ways, they wished they could see him again. And then, it happened - a few days later, they saw Yeti and he became their friend. He would often come visit them and they would share stories and hot chocolate together.

From that day forward, Yeti became a legend among the people of the north. He is still remembered today and will remain in the hearts and tales of the people of the north for many years to come.
