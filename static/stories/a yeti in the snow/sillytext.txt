One day, however, something changed. While Yeti was walking, he heard a voice in the distance. As he approached, he saw a small group of children. They were lost and afraid and Yeti could tell they needed help. So, in a moment of pure spontinaeity, he decided to do a jig. He started tap dancing in the snow and then singing at the top of his lungs. The children were amazed and began to laugh and clap along.

The children thanked Yeti, and as they parted ways, they wished they could see him again. And then, it happened - a few days later, they saw Yeti and he became their friend. He would often come visit them and they would share stories and hot chocolate together. Yeti had a knack for making everyone laugh with his silly jokes and antics. 

From that day forward, Yeti became a legend among the people of the north. He is still remembered today and will remain in the hearts and tales of the people of the north for many years to come.
