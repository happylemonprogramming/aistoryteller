Once upon a time in a far away land, there was a magical tree house. It was in the very center of a forest, and it glowed brightly in the night sky.

One day, a brother and sister were walking through the forest. They heard a mysterious humming noise coming from the tree house. When they looked up, they saw a light shining from the top of the tree house.

The brother and sister decided to explore the tree house. As the brother and sister entered the tree house, they were amazed by the magical sights inside. The walls were lined with books and paintings, and the ceilings were alive with dancing stars.

The two children soon discovered that the tree house was filled with magical powers. With each new discovery, the children were able to unlock new powers. They could grant wishes, make things fly, and even turn themselves into animals! 

They spent many days exploring the magical tree house and learning all of its secrets. Every day was a wonderful new adventure. 

Eventually, the days of exploration came to an end and the brother and sister had to go home. But they promised to keep the magical tree house a secret forever. And they did – till this day no one knows about it. 

The End.
