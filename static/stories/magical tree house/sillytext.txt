The two children soon discovered that the tree house was filled with magical powers. With each new discovery, the children were able to unlock new powers. They could grant wishes, make things fly, and even become next-level gamers! 

They spent many days exploring the magical tree house and learning all of its secrets. Every day was a silly and ridiculous adventure.

Eventually, the days of exploration came to an end and the brother and sister had to go home. But they promised to keep the magical tree house a secret forever. And they did – till this day no one knows about it... except for their pet goldfish, who curiously loves to share stories!
