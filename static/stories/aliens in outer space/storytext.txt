Once upon a time in a far away galaxy, there lived a group of aliens called the Luturnians. They lived on a planet called Luturna, which was far out in outer space.

The Luturnians were peaceful creatures who loved to explore the universe. They often traveled around in their rocketships, looking for new planets to explore and new friends to meet.

One day, the Luturnians came across a strange new planet they had never seen before. This planet was called Earth. When they arrived, the Luturnians were amazed by the life they found—trees, plants, animals, and humans!

The Luturnians introduced themselves to the humans and soon became friends. They taught the humans about their home planet and all the wonderful things it had to offer.

The humans and the Luturnians had many fun adventures together, learning about each other and the secrets of the universe. To this day, the Luturnians still go back to visit their human friends on Earth every once in a while.

The end.
