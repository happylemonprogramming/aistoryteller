Stella was so excited and quickly agreed. Together, they zoomed through the dark forest, picking up silly hats and dresses along the way. They found some peculiar food to try and made some new unicorn friends. Everyone laughed together in the moonlight, playing silly games and pretending to be cartoon characters. 

Eventually, the group returned back home to the magical land. Stella thanked her new friends for such a silly journey, and she was forever thankful for all the funny moments she had with the unicorns.

The moral of the story is to never be scared of exploring the world around you, as you never know what silly things may await.
