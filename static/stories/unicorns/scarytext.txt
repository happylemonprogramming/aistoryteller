Stella was hesitant, but eventually agreed to join her unicorn friends on a journey through the dark forest. As they galloped through the looming trees, Stella could feel an eerie presence. The unicorns continued on, seemingly unaware of the danger that lurked nearby. Along the way, they found food, made new friends, but the laughter quickly stopped when a distant howl filled the night air. 

The group anxiously looked around and pressed onward. When they finally reached home in the magical land, Stella was relieved to be out of the forest. She thanked her friends for keeping her safe, but she was still terrified of what could have happened in the woods.

The moral of this story is to be aware of your surroundings at all times, as you never know what dark secrets the world may hold.
